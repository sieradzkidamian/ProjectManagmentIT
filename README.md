# Managing Courses in a Mobile Application

## Introduction

Welcome! Today, we would like to present to you our new project - a mobile application for managing courses. Our solution aims to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to manage their courses on mobile devices. In this presentation, we will showcase the key features and benefits of our application.

## Features

1. **Browsing available courses**: Our application allows users to browse through a wide range of available courses. Users can filter courses based on categories, difficulty level, start date, and more.

2. **Course registration**: Users can easily register for selected courses using the mobile application. We can track their learning progress, provide educational materials, and send reminders about upcoming lessons.

3. **Schedule management**: The application enables users to manage their class schedules. Users can set reminders for upcoming lessons, ensuring they never miss a class.

4. **Offline mode**: Our application allows users to download course materials to their local data storage, enabling them to access them even without an internet connection. This is a perfect solution for travelers or those with limited internet access.

5. **Notes and assignments**: Users can create their own notes and assignments related to a specific course. This useful tool helps with organizing studies and monitoring progress.

## Benefits

1. **Mobility**: Our application provides users with access to their courses from anywhere, at any time. They can continue their learning journey regardless of their location.

2. **Personalization**: The application allows users to customize their educational experience. They can choose courses based on their interests and adjust their class schedules to their preferences.

3. **Notifications and reminders**: Our application sends users notifications and reminders about upcoming lessons, assignments, and more, aiding in organization and timely completion of courses.

4. **Offline learning**: The ability to download course materials and use them offline allows users to continue learning even without an internet connection. This is particularly beneficial for users who travel frequently or have limited internet access.

# Working in Scrum on the Project

## Introduction

Working in the Scrum methodology is a popular approach to project management that enables flexibility, iteration, and a focus on business value. In the case of our project, which involves managing courses in a mobile application, the team consisted of the following roles:

- Damian Sieradzki - Product Owner
- Kacper Przybylski - Scrum Master
- Mateusz Kucharek - Developer
- Krzysiek Małecki - Developer
- Piotr Makieła - Developer

## Roles Breakdown

1. **Product Owner (Damian Sieradzki)**: Damian served as the Product Owner, responsible for managing the product aspect of the project. His main task was to understand user needs and the business goals of the project, and then create and prioritize the product backlog. Damian ensured that the project met client expectations and delivered value to the users.

2. **Scrum Master (Kacper Przybylski)**: Kacper fulfilled the role of the Scrum Master, responsible for ensuring the proper implementation and adherence to the Scrum methodology. His tasks included removing impediments, organizing Scrum meetings, and ensuring team efficiency. Kacper also served as a mentor and coach, supporting other team members in understanding and implementing Scrum principles.

3. **Developers (Mateusz Kucharek, Krzysiek Małecki, Piotr Makieła)**: Mateusz, Krzysiek, and Piotr were developers tasked with implementing the application's functionalities. They worked as a development team, employing agile practices such as sprint planning, creating product increments, and holding daily meetings. Their goal was to deliver valuable, functioning parts of the application in each sprint.

## Scrum Meetings

During the work in Scrum, the team conducted regular meetings to support the project process:

1. **Sprint Planning**: In this meeting, the Product Owner (Damian) presented the product backlog, and the team decided which tasks would be tackled in the upcoming sprint. Sprint goals were established, and expected outcomes were defined.

2. **Daily Scrum**: The team gathered daily for a short, 15-minute meeting to discuss progress, challenges, and plans for the day. Kacper, as the Scrum Master, ensured that the meeting focused on work progress and identified any impediments. We held ceremonies every 3 days a week.

3. **Sprint Review**: At the end of each sprint, the team presented completed tasks and achieved results. The Product Owner (Damian) evaluated whether the set goals were met and whether the delivered functionalities aligned with client expectations.

4. **Sprint Retrospective**: This meeting involved reflecting on the past sprint and discussing opportunities for improvement. Team members shared their observations and proposed enhancements to be implemented in the next sprint. Kacper, as the Scrum Master, facilitated this retrospective to ensure open and constructive discussions.

# Summary

Working in Scrum methodology on the project of managing courses in a mobile application allowed our team to embrace flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. The roles of Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers were well-defined, ensuring a smooth workflow and effective project management.

The Scrum meetings, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, played a crucial role in facilitating communication, tracking progress, and identifying areas for improvement. The Product Owner (Damian) ensured that the project met user needs and aligned with business goals, while the Scrum Master (Kacper) supported the team in adhering to Scrum principles and resolving any obstacles.

Throughout the three sprints, the team focused on delivering valuable increments of the application. From establishing core functionalities in Sprint 1, to expanding course management features in Sprint 2, and refining the application based on user feedback in Sprint 3, the Developers (Mateusz, Krzysiek, and Piotr) consistently worked to meet project objectives.

Overall, our experience working in Scrum on this project was highly collaborative and allowed for continuous improvement. By following Scrum principles, the team successfully delivered a functional and user-centric mobile application for course management.
